# Requirements
The application requires .NET Framework 4.7, you can find them on microsoft's website: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime

# How to use
First thing is that you must have the NGM (Nexon Game Manager) installed.
Then you must find out the GameID of the game you want to start.
Then you must pass it as the first argument to the app, then you just have to run the application and login, it opens the browser where you type your login information.

When you want to directly launch the game you choose the Launch option and when you want/need to patch, just choose the Patch option

By default this uses the Korean locale and login url, to change those is again by arguments.
Second argument is the locale and the third argument is the login url.

# Other things to note
I only tested this with MapleStory 2 and Elsword, both being the Korean version. Some games don't allow some certain "modes" (Launch/Patch).

If you know other modes out there feel free to post an issue and I'll try to look into it!
